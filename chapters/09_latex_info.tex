\chapquote{Research is formalised curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.}
          {Zora Neale Hurston}
          
Each chapter should start with a short explanation what is inside the upcoming chapter and why it has been included (at this position) in your work: This template shall provide some considerations, text examples and formatting hints for your Bachelor's or Master's thesis in \LaTeX{}.


\section{Hints on Scientific Writing}

Some recommendations on writing an abstract and about including references to related work. 

\subsection{How to Write an Abstract}

Learn from others and read many papers\footnote{For examples, read the abstract of paper \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03677}.} related to your work. Finally, you might ensure that your abstract contains:%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item English \& German Version (250 – 350 words each)
		\item Background / motivation / problem statement 
		\item Methods / procedure / approach
		\item Results / findings / product
		\item Conclusion and implications
	\end{itemize}

It is easier to write the Abstract when the rest of your paper is finished.

\subsection{Research Resources}


For literature research\footnote{You might start your search within the scientific databases \url{http://dl.acm.org/} or \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}. Full-text PDF download is available from within the FH JOANNEUM network.} use e.g. \citetitle{acm:diglibrary} \parencite{acm:diglibrary} or \citetitle{ieee:xplore} \parencite{ieee:xplore}.

\subsection{Citation Styles}
Harvard citation style is implemented in this template. For information about a topic like RFID paraphrased in your own words~\parencite[cf.][pg 317]{Batina:2011} do not forget to use \emph{cf.} and -- if available the relevant page numbers -- along with parenthetical cite \emph{\\parencite}. Direct quotations would not need the \emph{cf.}. If you need to use the title of a reference, for example the RFID Authentication Protocol by \citetitle{Fernandez-Mir:2011} you might use \verb+\citetitle+. For references without parentheses (find more in \cite{Li:2008}) just use \verb+\cite+ or -- if year should be in parentheses -- \textcite{Batina:2011} \verb+\textcite+.

\begin{spar}
Note the use of \emph{ibid} (in German \emph{ebd} or \emph{ebenda}) for referencing (several pages of) the same resource subsequently. For example, see \citep[cf.][pg 317]{Batina:2011} and \citep[cf.][pg 321]{Batina:2011} \citep[cf.][pg 399]{Batina:2011}.
\end{spar}

You might cite URLs, e.g. about (tools for checking) Accessibility~\parencite[cf.][]{Google:2017a,Google:2016a}, as online resources with a date of your last visit.


\subsection{Scientific Writing Resources}

% Write intro for items ending with a ":" colon

Selected resources about scientific working: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{\citetitle{Zobel:2004}}: \ldots elements of good writing - clarity, simplicity, accuracy, and organization \ldots by \cite{Zobel:2004}.
  
  \item \emph{\citetitle{Yin:2013}}: \ldots offers comprehensive coverage of the design and use of the case study method as a valid research tool \ldots by \cite{Yin:2013}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Strunk:2000}}: \ldots first edition about 1935; includes a list of valuable recommendations: be clear, do not overwrite \ldots by \cite{Strunk:2000}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Field:2003}}: \ldots Planning an Experiment, Experimental Designs, Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Statistics \ldots Answering the Question 'So What?' \ldots by \cite{Field:2003}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Booth:2008}}: \ldots What Is Research? Creating a Relationship with Your Reader: Your Role, Finding a Good Research Problem \ldots by \cite{Booth:2008}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Alley:1998}}: \ldots your writing is the principle way in which people learn about your work. When you communicate well, you receive credit for your \ldots by \cite{Alley:1998}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Eco:2010}}: \ldots Warum muss man eine wissenschaftliche Abschlussarbeit schreiben und was ist sie? \ldots by \cite{Eco:2010}.

  \item \emph{\citetitle{Wisconsin:2004}}: \ldots you will find many instructional materials we've developed for our Writing Center teaching: Planning and Writing Research Papers, Creating an Argument, \ldots by \cite{Wisconsin:2004}.

\end{itemize}

Finally, before starting to write you might take a look at some of these references.


\section{\LaTeX{} Formatting Hints}

Selected \LaTeX{} examples are included to give an impression of how you could add tables, diagrams, or figures to your text. Use \emph{bullet lists} and \emph{emphasised} text sparsely. 


%% example for a named paragraph
%\paragraph{Background.} Describe the background, the prerequisites for your work \ldots
%\paragraph{Objective.} The aim of this master's thesis is \ldots

%\subsection{Examples for named paragraphs}
\paragraph{Terms and definitions.}
Technical terms \ldots\ abbreviations are summarised at the end of the thesis in Chapter~\ref{chap:acronyms} ``\nameref{chap:acronyms}''. For example, \ac{ABI} or \ac{MITM}. If \ac{ABI} is referenced again, only the acronym is printed (as hyperlink though).

To support your readers, include visuals such as diagrams and other graphics (Figure~\ref{fig:engine}). Note the short title used for the list of figures.




\begin{figure}[tp]
  \centering
  \copyrightbox[r]{  
  \includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=0.95\textwidth]{images/engine}
  }{\tiny \copyright~Diethard Ohrt}
  % The short caption should be capitalised
  % The full caption should hold a full sentence. 
 \caption[Logo at the Train Engine]{Note the logo attached to the train engine spotted in Kapfenberg main station.}
  \label{fig:engine}
\end{figure}

Code listings require the \textit{listings} package which, in turn, requires some settings\footnote{\ldots because the defaults do not fit all purposes}; see command \verb+\lstset{}+ in preamble of this template. Additionally the package \textit{courier} should be used because the defaults do not provide for proper syntax highlighting.

% settings for all listings
\lstset{
  caption={Listing subtitles could and should contain whole sentences describing the important aspect of the listing.}, 
  basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, 
  label=lst:main, 
  %float=tbhp, % float image to top/bottom/here/page
  language=C,
  frame=single,
  breaklines=true, % break long source code lines, and add arrow
  postbreak=\mbox{\textcolor{red}{$\hookrightarrow$}\space},
  %  basewidth={0.55em}, 
  % fontadjust}  % adjust these for more appealing appearance
}

% listing with some settings, such as float, for this listing only
%\begin{samepage}% with samepage we keep a FLOATing listing on one page
%	\begin{lstlisting}[float=tbhp]
%void main(int argc, char *argv[])
%{
%  printf("Hello world!");
%}
%	\end{lstlisting}
%\end{samepage}
	

In order to see what's possible -- here are two fancy tables, see Table~\ref{tab:olive} and Table~\ref{tab:grey} which show \ldots.

  \end{table}
\end{center}

        & \small{(Eclipse default:}\\
      \rowcolor{gray20}  	  	  
        & \small{-Xms40m -Xmx512m)} \\
    \end{tabular}
    % The short caption should be capitalised
    % The full caption should hold a full sentence. 
    \caption[Simple Grey Table]{A more or less simple grey table. Better try to put tables and figures at \textit{top}[t] or at the \textit{bottom}[b] of a page. With \textit{page}[p] you can put them on a separate page. Avoid location specifier \textit{here}[h].}
    \label{tab:grey}
  \end{table}
\end{center}



Always reference listings in text, such as Listing~\ref{lst:main}. Use line numbers to help the reader to find relevant parts within given code. Referenced listings, tables and figures are written in uppercase first letter: \emph{L}isting X,  \emph{T}able Y and  \emph{F}igure Z.




\subsection{Prototype}

Find in Listing~\ref{lst:democlosure} an example of the JavaScript closure. Only selected (relevant) parts of the original source code have been included. That allows to extract and display parts of working code!

% use environment "samepage", for not breaking 
% the listing in multiple parts and not spreading the
% listing over multiple pages
\begin{samepage} 
\lstinputlisting[language=JavaScript,
 float=tp,                % float to the "best" place
 aboveskip=\floatsep,
 belowskip=\floatsep,
 xleftmargin=0cm,         % no extra margins for floats
 xrightmargin=0cm,        % no extra margins for floats
 %
 label=lst:democlosure,   % reference to this listing
 firstline=10,            % include just a few lines 
 lastline=88,             % of the given file
 caption={[Closure]       % Short Title for LOL List of Listings
          Demo implementation of a JavaScript \emph{Closure}.}
]{src/closure.js}         % the file to be included
\end{samepage}

Mathematical expressions are rendered beautifully by \LaTeX. Now enjoy the first Maxwell equation 
\begin{math} 
  \text{rot} \vec{H} = \vec{J} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t} 
\end{math}.




At the end of each chapter you might sum up the contents of the chapter in a sentence or two. Then you might tell the reader what will be presented in the upcoming section (to make her/him curious).


  \TODO{You have seen how \LaTeX~works; now remove this Chapter 1.}
